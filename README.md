## About

Rotodex is a companion app for Pokemon Trainers. It allows you to keep track of your pokemon collection as you work toward completing your pokedex. You can search pokemon by name, type, generation, or even by collected status. Rotodex also allows you to view your collection in a variety of ways, including a list, a grid, and a card. Rotodex is written in [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

<!-- What was your motivation? -->

As an avid pokemon card collector, I wanted a way to keep track of my collection digitally. I also wanted to be able to view my collection in a variety of ways, including a list, a grid, and by invidiual pokemon card. I also wanted to be able to search the pokedex in a variety of ways and filter my view to see which pokemon I'm missing.

<!-- Why did you build this project? -->

I wanted to learn React Native and to build something that I could use in my daily work. I also wanted to learn how to use the [React Native Elements](https://react-native-elements.github.io/) library. Thus, I decided to build Rotodex.
